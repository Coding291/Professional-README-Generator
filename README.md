# Professional-README-Generator

* Using the command line and node.js we answered all the questions and at the end generated a separate file with proper format according to the requirements. In this case, it was a README file.

* First we install inquirer since that is the most convinient package to work with. We created two js files one with all the prompts and the that function being called and the other file that would export the file then create and generate as README template to show the output.
